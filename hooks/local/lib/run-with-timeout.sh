# Fusebase Flow — bounded-execution helper (sourced by the health-check engine).
#
# PROVENANCE:
#   Extracted from fusebase-flow-health-check.sh per FR-25 (module-size ratchet)
#   so the engine stays under the 800-line ceiling. Lives at hooks/local/lib/ —
#   outside the FuseBase CLI refresh manifest, so it survives `fusebase update`.
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Bound the engine's slow, verdict-affecting operations (preflight, run-tests,
#   conflict reporter, upstream git fetch) so a network-impaired or large-repo
#   host can't make the read-only diagnostic appear to hang.
#
# CONTRACT (relied on by the engine's verdict logic — do not change silently):
#   FFHC_TIMEOUT_BIN     — set by ffhc_detect_timeout: "timeout" | "gtimeout" | "" (none)
#   run_with_timeout SECS CMD...
#     rc 124  => the wrapped command timed out (the timeout binary's own signal rc)
#     rc 137  => the wrapped command ignored TERM and was SIGKILLed after the -k
#                grace (128+9) — also a timeout-induced kill
#     other   => the wrapped command's OWN rc, preserved (NOT squashed to 0/1)
#   ffhc_timed_out RC    => returns 0 (true) iff RC is timeout-induced (124 or 137)

# Detect a usable timeout binary. GNU coreutils ships `timeout` (Linux, Git-Bash);
# macOS commonly ships only `gtimeout` (from coreutils via Homebrew). Sets the
# module-global FFHC_TIMEOUT_BIN to the binary name, or "" when neither exists.
# FFHC_FORCE_NO_TIMEOUT=1 forces the no-binary path (testability + an operator
# escape to exercise the degraded behavior on a host that does have timeout).

# Timeout-induced rc: 124 = GNU-timeout's "duration elapsed"; 137 = 128+SIGKILL, the
# rc when `-k <grace>` SIGKILLs a child that ignored the initial TERM. Both must read
# as a timeout so a hung-then-SIGKILLed critical is UNVERIFIED, not a spurious other
# state. Accepted limitation: a wrapped command's OWN legit exit 124/137 (e.g. it
# self-SIGKILLs) is also treated as a timeout — acceptable for these read-only criticals.

# run_with_timeout SECS CMD [ARGS...]
#   Runs CMD bounded to SECS via the detected timeout binary with a -k grace
#   window (a follow-up KILL if the command ignores the initial TERM). Returns
#   124 on timeout; otherwise the wrapped command's own exit code is preserved.
#   Caller MUST have run ffhc_detect_timeout and confirmed FFHC_TIMEOUT_BIN is
#   non-empty (no-binary handling is a verdict decision the engine owns, not this
#   helper — H5).

#   Runs CMD per the no-binary policy and records the result in module-globals
#   the engine reads. Captures combined stdout+stderr so callers can parse it.

#     FFHC_LAST_RC        — wrapped command's own rc (124 on timeout; 125 sentinel when skipped)

#     FFHC_LAST_SKIPPED   — 1 iff the run was skipped because no timeout binary exists, else 0
#   Policy (H5): if no timeout binary AND FFHC_ALLOW_UNBOUNDED!=1 => SKIP (no run,
#   sentinel rc 125, FFHC_LAST_SKIPPED=1) so a slow op can never hang the engine;
#   FFHC_ALLOW_UNBOUNDED=1 opts into an unbounded run instead.
