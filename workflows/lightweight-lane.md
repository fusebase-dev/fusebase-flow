# Workflow: lightweight-lane

> **Style:** Mode-B-lite. The FR-21 variant of the lifecycle for small / reversible / low-risk changes. One change-note, one agent pass, a plain operator go-ahead. The full safety floor is kept.

## When to run

Chosen at Specify when the eligibility gate in `skills/lightweight-lane/SKILL.md` passes (ALL of): small implementation + single concern · reversible · mechanically-verifiable acceptance · no new security surface · no public-contract decision · root cause understood. **In doubt → Full lane** (`workflows/eight-phase-flow.md`).

## Procedure (single AI Developer session — no two-agent split)

1. **Confirm tier.** Re-check the eligibility gate. If any condition fails or there is doubt → STOP, use the Full lane.
2. **Pre-task checkpoint.** Git checkpoint per `workflows/git-workflow.md` (so revert is clean).
3. **Write the change-note** from `templates/change-note.md` (problem · change · verified · rollback · `change_tier: lightweight`). Inline in the commit body for the smallest changes, or `docs/changes/<date>-<slug>.md`.
4. **Make the change.** Single coherent concern. If scope grows past a couple files / surfaces a risk / needs a decision / reveals a deeper bug → STOP and promote (see below).
5. **Lint + typecheck** (FR-13).
6. **Build once.**
7. **Live-verify** — run the probe/measurement; apply the `validation-and-qa` 3-question empirical test to the acceptance criterion (did it run on a real input · observed vs expected · reproducible from the note). This is the safety floor; never skip it.
8. **Commit** — one commit (FR-03). Record the SHA in the change-note.
9. **FR-07 re-check** — `git diff` against `policies/protected-paths.yml`. Must be clean.
10. **Operator deploy go-ahead (FR-19, chat text).** Ask for an explicit plain go-ahead ("ship it" / "deploy it" / "go"). **Never auto-deploy.** No DP.6 magic phrase, no DP.1 hand-authored JSON, no separate deploy session. (Hook-wired projects: record the go-ahead with `bash hooks/local/approve-local.sh lightweight_deploy <slug> 'ship it'` — one command. Hooks are opt-in; in the default off setup the chat go-ahead is the gate.)
11. **Deploy** (exact command from `AGENTS.md`). Capture the deploy hash.
12. **Report in 1–3 lines:** what changed · live-proof result (observed vs expected) · deploy SHA/hash · one-line rollback.
13. **Log the tier** — one line in `docs/changes/index.md` (`<date> · <slug> · lightweight · <SHA>`).

## Self-attestation

The same role attestation as any AI Developer session (per `FLOW_RULES.md` § Self-attestation, FR-01..FR-21), naming the AI Developer role and `skills/role-discipline/SKILL.md`. Add one line: "Running the Lightweight Lane (FR-21): one change-note, one build→verify→deploy pass, plain operator go-ahead; safety floor (live proof, explicit go-ahead, FR-07, rollback, one commit) kept; I will STOP and promote to Full if this turns non-trivial."

## Mid-flight promotion (mandatory)

If the change touches more than a couple files, surfaces a risk, needs a real decision, or reveals a deeper bug → **STOP.** Do not keep coding. Open a Full-lane spec (`requirements-specification`), carry over what you learned, and record `<date> · <slug> · promoted lightweight→full · <reason>` in `docs/changes/index.md`. Promotion is the gate working, not a failure.

## What stays vs what's dropped

- **Kept (both lanes):** live proof · explicit operator deploy go-ahead · FR-07 protected-path check · documented one-line rollback · one commit + SHA · lint+typecheck per commit.
- **Dropped (LL only):** separate spec/decisions/tasks/verification-gate + two handoff docs · DP.1 JSON artifact · DP.6 magic phrase · two-agent build-then-deploy split (→ no redundant rebuild) · long-form gate report.
